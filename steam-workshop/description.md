Federations brought us the fancy new Origin system! You want more?
- I've got you covered: This mod adds [b]Even More Origins[/b] to the number of vanilla ones!

[h1]Origin Description & Features[/h1]
Below is a list of all included Origins, describing their features. Due to the steam workshop character limit I had to drop the flavorful background stories, but you should definitely check them all out in game!

[h2]Back to the Future[/h2]
Start in a maximum sized Trinary System on a size 26 Relic World orbited by two Relic Moons (size 1 and 11). Your species has the Relic World Habitability.

[h2]Ecosystem Integration[/h2]
Start on a Hive World.

[h2]Eldest Sibling[/h2]
Start with up to two primitive civilizations in your home system. At the start of the game you can choose whether to spawn one or two primitive civilizations and if they're of your own species or randomly generated ones.

[h2]Endeavour to Enlightenment[/h2]
Your leaders have a 20% chance to retain their level. Their leader experience gain is increased by 200%, and your effective councilor skill is increased by 2 as well. Agendas progress 20% faster and last 20% longer. Your leaders have a 20% increased upkeep and cost 200% more to hire.

[h2]Fratricide[/h2]
Paradox had dropped this idea from among their planned Origins - so here's me rushing to the rescue: This allows you to start in a system together with a Tomb World. Funnily enough they did add a picture sprite for this already.

[h2]Legacy of Nine Suns[/h2]
Start on a size 30 home world that orbits a Black Hole. Oh, and 9 different stars are part of this system. 
Feast your eyes on this glorious home system! 
I recommend reloading a few times to check out different effects (depending on the angle it generates you can end up with different camera tints - blue is rarest). 
Naturally, living in the presence of so many stars is dangerous: The Superflare event chain will fire for your home world.
If you are also subscribed to [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructural Engineering[/url], then your civilization will have thought of building a Birch World around the core of the collided galaxy - and if you don't block it with other megastructures - you will be able to build it here, in your home system after taking the Ascension Perk.

[h2]Out of Sight, Out of Mind[/h2]
Start with a Subterranean Civilization on your home world. This gives powerful bonuses in the form of additional districts or some districts and powerful jobs at the cost of losing quite a bit of science income for a while. If you aren't careful, they might take over the planet. And you don't want that, do you?

[h2]The Chosen One[/h2]
Your ruler is the Chosen One, an immortal, level 10 leader. They will allow you to start researching Psionic Theory right from the beginning. Though you probably shouldn't do that as it would take about 72 months.

[h2]Walking On Eggshells[/h2]
Start with a Voidspawn growing inside your Home Planet. It will hatch and destroy your empire capital.
You will be able to pick how long it takes at the start of the game. Choose from options between certain annihilation at 1 year and the 'very challenging' timeframe of 100 years. 
List of possible options:
[list]
[*] 1 year (impossible, if you do not get a habitable planet in a neighbouring system - and the default ones are disabled by this origin / I haven't been able to clear this myself, yet)
[*] 1.5 years (slightly less punishing, allows you to colonize a planet a little farther away)
[*] 2 years (you don't have to get really lucky to be able to find and colonize a planet with this - build an extra science ship, explore until you find the first planet and go for that one immediately)
[*] 3 years
[*] 4 years
[*] 5 years (recommended, you have some time to explore, but will probably still lose all of your starting population)
[*] 7 years (recommended, slightly less punishing - you might even save a few pops)
[*] 10 years (recommended, if you don't think losing most of your pops is cool)
[*] 15 years
[*] 25 years
[*] 100 years (for everybody who would just like to fight a voidspawn without a particularly challenging start)
[/list]
The screenshots are from the 1.5 and 2 years options.

[h1]Future Development & Compatibility Notes[/h1]
I am still adding more Origins to the mod (albeit slowly), as well as working on supporting compatibility with other mods, so please feel free to keep any ideas coming my way! 
A specific mod you like doesn't work with this one? Report in detail, and I will fix the issue! Thank you for all the support!

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]
Only the latest version of the game is supported, as several Origins use solar_system_initializers and the mod interface has been changed for these with 2.6.3

As of Mod Version 1.5.1 [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=819148835]Planetary Diversity[/url] is fully compatible!
It is now possible to use the "Eldest Sibling" Origin with a home world from that mod.
Even the [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1732437279]Planetary Diversity - Exotic World[/url] ones!
Any randomly generated worlds will also spawn using the Planetary Diversity list of normal and rare planet classes.

As of Mod Version 1.6.0 [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1121692237]Gigastructural Engineering[/url] will allow you to build a Birch World around the supermassive black hole featured by the "Legacy of Nine Suns" origin (a new save game is required).

All of the added features above are optional. There's no need to subscribe to any more mods, if you don't want to do so in the first place.

This mod should also be fully compatible with almost any other mod (even those adding more origins). No vanilla files were touched. There's two small exceptions: I have overwritten the following events: [code]colony.50 # Allowed Subterranean Civilization to fire on empire capitals[/code][code]utopia.2650 # fixed The Chosen One getting the Psionic trait[/code]
